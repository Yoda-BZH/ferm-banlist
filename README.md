ferm-banlist
============

Banlist builder for ferm.

The script add-ip take an IP as argument.

It performs various operations to get the ip range (CIDR) and add it to a banlist.

build-ips generate a list of IP ranges suitable for ferm (for Easy Rule Making - http://ferm.foo-projects.org/)

I have included my personnal banlist.
